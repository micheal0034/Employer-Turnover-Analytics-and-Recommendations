# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Predicting the quality of a wine

## Business Background and Project Overview
The Board of the production department of a large corporation I work for is worried about the relatively high production of wine and wants me to build a model that predict if the wine is good or not. As a Data Scientist on the team assigned to this task, I am to build a model to better understand the situation.
