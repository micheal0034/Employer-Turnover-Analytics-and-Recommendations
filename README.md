## Employer Turnover Analytics and Recommendations
The Board of the human capital department of a large corporation I work for is worried about the relatively high
turnover of employees. As an analyst on the team assigned to this task, I am to provide a report to help the board better understand the situation:

which employees are more likely to leave
which department has the highest employee turnover and which one has the lowest
which variables seem to be indicators of employee departure


## Summary of Key Insights and Recommendations
The profile of employees at high risk of attrition include employees that:

are involved in low number of projects (3 or less)
work shorter hours (less than 184 hours monthly on average)
work in the company for about 5 to 8 years
are mostly high performers (review score of 0.7 or more)
gave satisfaction scores of less than 0.7
are in the sales, retail, engineering or operations department
received medium salary
had no bonus in the previous 24 months
had not been promoted in the previous 24 months
The recommendations are to:

provide high performers and passives bonuses and promotions in shorter time periods than 24 months
increase the salary of such employees
ensure the employees are more engaged by giving them more projects to work on
have incentives and packages to celebrate long service (between 5 to 8 years) to improve employee retainership
